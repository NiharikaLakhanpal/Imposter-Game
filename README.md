# Imposter-Game
CLI based Imposter Game built using just python basics.

## How it works
- One random player becomes imposter
- One random word is chosen
- All the players except imposter see the selected word
- Everyone speaks a word they relate to the secret word
- All the players try to find the imposter but the imposter tries to get mixed in them
- Finally with the help of program they can reveal who is the actual imposter

## Technologies Used
- Basic Python
- Random Module
- Loops and Conditions
- Input / Output Handling
- Optional IPython `clear_output` for better UX in Colab and Jupyter

## How to Run the Game

### 1. Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Open the file in Google Colab  
2. Run the notebook cell by cell  
3. Follow on-screen instructions to play

### 2. Local Python Environment

1. Download the file `imposter_game.py`
2. Run it using: python imposter_game.py

> Note: The screen-clearing feature works best in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environments.

## Game Flow

1. Enter number of players  
2. Either add custom player names or use the default values like Player1, Player2...  
3. Program selects a random secret word  
4. One random player becomes the imposter  
5. Each player privately views the secret word (for imposter it will be shown - You are the imposter)  
6. Players discuss and try to identify the imposter  
7. Program reveals the imposter at the end
